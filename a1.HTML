 <h2> Facts about parrot</h2>
<p>
Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak, upright
stance, and clawed feet.[a] They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found
mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae
(African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot
species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other
comparable bird group.[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate
regions as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.[5]

Parrots—along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies—are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some
species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. They form the most variably sized bird order in terms
of length; many are vividly coloured and some, multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in
the visual spectrum.

The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material. A few
species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar
and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which
hatch altricial (helpless) young.

Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has
diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of wild birds. As of
2021, about 50 million parrots (half of all parrots) live in captivity, with the vast majority of these living as pets
in people's homes.[6] Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also
protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.

Parrots are the only creatures that display true tripedalism, using their necks and beaks as limbs with propulsive
forces equal to or greater than those forces generated by the forelimbs of primates when climbing vertical surfaces.
They can travel with cyclical tripedal gaits when climbing.
